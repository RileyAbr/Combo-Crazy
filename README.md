# Combo-Crazy
 
A side scroller built for the 2017 NDSU ACM GameMaker Game Jam. The game features a customizable combo system where the player can select individual moves to piece together a move set. Along the level, there are plenty of jumping and combat challenges before ending with a mini-boss. As a proof of concept for the game jam, it earned 2nd place.
